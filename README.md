#### About metaX

metaX is a platform specializing in NFT nurturing, distinguished by its dynamic NFT feature that adds value potential to NFTs. The platform offers free NFTs, allowing everyone to own an NFT and participate in this ecosystem. NFT nurturing can be achieved through purchasing food or engaging on Twitter. To enhance the platform's appeal, metaX has introduced a task module where users can accumulate points by completing Twitter tasks such as following and tweeting. Additionally, a lottery module rewards users with raffle tickets when purchasing tokens, allowing them to participate in lottery events. After each lottery, a lucky user will be chosen to receive points, tokens, or food. To ensure trust, metaX records and stores all user actions and NFT changes, maintaining transparency and credibility. For increased user rewards, metaX employs a staking module, allowing users to stake their NFTs to earn returns.

#### Social Platform Integration

On metaX, the NFT nurturing mechanism is facilitated through social interactions, allowing users to redeem resources by liking, commenting, and retweeting. The platform also incorporates a task module interacting with Twitter, broadening user engagement and strengthening the platform's social aspects. Users can interact not only with other users but also with the platform itself, enhancing both interactivity and activity.

#### Nurturing

metaX offers two types of NFT nurturing: free and paid. Free nurturing involves redeeming required resources through social interactions on tweets, such as likes, comments, and retweets. This method encourages user participation through simple social actions. Paid nurturing, on the other hand, requires tokens to purchase food. This design provides users with diverse options and enriches the platform's interactive experience. Users can choose the nurturing method that best suits their preferences and needs, increasing the platform's flexibility and appeal.

#### Tasks

The task module on metaX is mainly related to Twitter interactions. Users can earn points by completing tasks, which can then be redeemed for food to nurture NFTs. This task design not only expands engagement opportunities but also offers a fun and easy way to obtain resources, boosting user participation and loyalty.

#### Lottery

Users receive raffle tickets when purchasing metaX tokens, enabling them to participate in the platform's lottery events. These lotteries offer rewards such as food, points, or tokens. The lottery feature enhances user engagement by providing additional reward opportunities, increasing platform stickiness and activity.

#### Swap

This feature allows users to exchange other tokens for platform tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to purchase food. The addition of this function provides more payment options, increasing the platform's flexibility and convenience.

#### Operation Records

To ensure transparency, metaX records all user actions and their outcomes. This measure protects user interests and ensures fair treatment on the platform. Storing and displaying operation records not only enhances transparency and credibility but also offers a supervisory mechanism for users, increasing their trust in the platform. Additionally, the platform will periodically publish summaries of operation records, providing users with a clearer understanding of the platform's operations and enhancing transparency and reputation.
